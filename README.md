# doctool

Tool for editing Valence UI-themed sites generated from Markdown

## Usage

```sh
npm install
./src/cli.js example
```

This will open up a browser with the live-rendered version of `example/`.

You can edit the files in `example/` in any editor. VS code works nicely and has a nice auto-save thing but any editor works.

## Recommended VS-code settings for awesomeness

```json
{
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
  "files.autoSaveDelay": 300
}
```
